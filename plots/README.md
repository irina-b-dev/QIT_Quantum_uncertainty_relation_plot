# PLOTS 

After running test.py there will be 4 images with plots here

-  **H(rho).png** contains : 4 plots with of the authors uncertainty relation compared to 3 others and the numerical optimum. 
for each supblot H(rho) has a different value: 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9
-  **Heatmaps.png** contains : black-and-white heatmaps for each bound and for the difference between each pair of bounds.
-  **HeatmapsNumericalOptimum.png** contains: black-and-white heatmaps for each bound and for the difference between each analitical bounds compared to the numerical optimum bound
-  **HeatmapOptimal-4VSHeatmapOptimal-14.png** contains: better comparison between eq4 and eq14 regarding their difference with the numerical optimum.

  Note: each heatmap has the its range normalized between the global minimum and the global maximum for better visual comparison. Each diffence is absolute, meaning that the darkest color corresponds to the overall minimum distance between two equations.
